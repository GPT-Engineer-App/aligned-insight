Elden is the go-to-tool for achieving goals, making decisions and running efficient meetings. At its core Elden collects and organizes all decisions, agreements and activities from project management tools such as Jira or Asana, task management apps and meetings.

Elden’s unique and innovative pre-meeting preparation tool makes sure that meetings are properly formatted, agendas are optimized, issues as well as opportunities are surfaced and participants are well prepared. Participants are invited to suggest topics for discussions and share pre-read materials in a structured and convenient manner. Any additions are approved by the meeting host and properly formatted.

The in-meeting collaboration tool with features such as asynchronous and synchronous brainstorming and polls leverage the collective intelligence of the meeting participants making sure that the very best decisions and agreements are made.

The post meeting tool summarizes the meeting and assigns all action based outcomes to a direct responsible individual (DRI) who is made accountable for the accomplishment. It also facilitates completion checkins by pre-populating agendas for the right follow-up meeting.

Elden is also powered and assisted by a generative AI assistant trained on leading science and frameworks for fostering productivity and collaboration within and between meetings and making sure users use the tool optimally.

Traditional meetings are often unproductive: Filled with distractions, poor planning, and unclear objectives, they waste time and hinder progress.
Alignment on goals is crucial: Effective meetings require a shared understanding of purpose and desired outcomes.

Technology can be a double-edged sword: Utilize tech tools that enhance focus and participation, but avoid distractions and information overload.
Practical Tips:

Define "Success": Clearly articulate the desired outcome and ensure the agenda aligns with achieving it.
Invite the Right People: Include only those who contribute directly to the meeting's purpose.
Pre-work is Essential: Share materials and information beforehand to ensure everyone is prepared.
